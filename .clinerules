## Build Preferences
- All completed code must be type-checked via pyright with uv run
- All completed code must be linted using ruff with uv run

## Running the Server
- The server can be started using the CLI script: `cosmo-server` (installed via the project's entry points)
- Alternatively, run directly with: `uv run python -m cosmoserver.cli`
- The server runs by default on http://127.0.0.1:8000 and supports development mode with `--dev` flag for auto-reload
- Use `--clean` for running without bundled plugins or `--bundle-only` to create the plugin bundle without starting the server
